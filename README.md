This repository is a [ShowOff](https://github.com/schacon/showoff) project for the talk I gave at the Grand Rapids Ruby meetup in March 2010.

[Running a Ruby application with jruby-complete](http://fletcherm.github.com/grruby-jruby-complete/#1)

If you weren't at the talk, then the slideshow may not make much sense. Too bad for you.
